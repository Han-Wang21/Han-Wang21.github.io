I am a PhD student in Qiuzhen College, Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Chenlin Gu in Tsinghua University and Prof. Yuval Peres in Beijing Institude of Mathematical Sciences and Applications.

My research interest is probability theory, including some stochastic processes and interacting particle systems. Currently I am focusing on the tug of war with noise process and corresponding p-harmonic functions. I am also interested in the general theory of interacting physical models.
